# Hand-gesture-recognition-system
A real-time hand gesture recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The project detects and classifies hand gestures through the webcam and displays live output with a graphical user interface (GUI). It also tracks how often each gesture occurs and visualizes it with real-time charts.
